# (the joy of) Movement

## Flatiron capstone project built in ~3 weeks by Lucy Bullen

Demo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kZziaGX_oQ
Hosted Website: https://movement-moose.herokuapp.com/
Planning: https://www.figma.com/file/HuYkjwEP8egrQBDUZQCD9r/Movement---DB-Schema-%26-Component-Tree?node-id=0%3A1

## Requirements

- Use a Rails API backend with a React frontend.
- Have at least three models on the backend, that include: -at least one one-to-many relationship -at least one many-to-many relationship -full CRUD actions for at least one resource
- Have at least three different client-side routes using React Router. Be sure to include a nav bar or other UI element that allows users to navigate between routes.
- Implement authentication/authorization, including password protection. A user should be able to log in to the site with a secure password and stay logged in via user ID in the session hash.

## Pitch

Login and track / record sessions of physical movements. A data dashboard will summarize all tracked movements of the current year.

As a user I can ...

- Login, signup and log out of the application
- Record a movement of my choice
- Add multiple movement types to one session (ie. if backcountry skiing, walking and skiing activities can be added to one session)
- Resume trakcing a movement after it has been stopped
- Add more details to the movement including decriptions and estimated exertion
- View all my recorded movement sessions
- View a current Year to Date summary of movements in two units of measure: number of movements and hours of movement
